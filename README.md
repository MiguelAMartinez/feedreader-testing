# Feedreader Jasmine testing
The goal of this project was to develop [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) functionality tests for
a given [Feedreader web application](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). 


## Functionality tests
The `feeedreader.js` file was modified in order to include the following tests: 

- RSS Feeds are defined, have URLs that are defined and not empty, and have names that are 
defined and not empty.

- The menu is hidden by default and changes visibility when the its icon is clicked.

- Initial Entries have at least one '.entry' element within the '.feed' container.

- New Feed Selection has a new feed with changing content

A successful test will display: 

![Alt text](/img/goodtest.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

## Run the application 
You can access the application online [here](https://miguelamartinez.github.io/feedreader-testing/). 

Additionally, you can download the repository and open the `index.html` file.
